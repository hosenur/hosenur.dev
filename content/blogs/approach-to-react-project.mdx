2020 was when I started my web development journey, at first I used plain HTML and CSS, without the JavaScript part. I started writing JavaScript for the first time in a React Project a very few days after I found myself repeating HTML tags and CSS classes, I knew there was a better way to do it, so I did some searches and found React.




### Atomic Design 
Whether it is the smallest component, a hook a utility function, a component or a context every file needs to solve only and only a single problem.
### 1 Drill at Max
If a prop needs to be passed two component deep , I consider it as a bad design and prefer putting it in a shared global store.
### Plain Fetch is boring
Axios is my go to library for making API calls, but simple Axios calls leave us with stale data until I make a refresh call, but all this is simplified as a cake walk with SWR.
### Hooks
Lets take for example in a app , we are dealign with projects namely creating them , deleting them and updating them. Now two scenarios arise, one is when the projects are accessed in a single page in the whole app or accessed in multiple componensts. 

In the fist case, I prefer usign a custom hook, let's take **useProjects** according to the atomic design principle, it will export all required functions to create, delete and update a project. Here is an example for the same.

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
const useProjects = () => {
    cosnt [projects, setProjects] = useState([]);
    useEffect(()=>{
        // fetch projects and setProjects
    },[])
    return {
        projects
    }
}
export default useProjects;
```
