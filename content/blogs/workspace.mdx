description : Creating a workspace for my daily driver, ricing up my distro and configuring apps

We all have been there, setting up a new machine, and installing all the tools we need to get our work done. I have been using a MSI Modern 15 Notebook as my daily driver and recently got Fedora installed in it. I have been using Windows before due to some hardware compatibility issues, but now they were fixed and having a Linux distro installed I did what every Linux Enthusiast would do - Rice it up.
