While I was building [duotone.ink](https://duotone.ink) : A developer first Invoicing SaaS which generated beafutifully crafted invoices and mails them directly to your customers and also provides a sharable link , make sure to check it out, I had to build a docs page. 

At first I planned to build the docs with [Nextra](https://nextra.site) which is a Next.JS static site generator which builds the pages from MDX. But then I came to know about [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com) which is a super beautiful and excellent docs generator

```tsx showLineNumbers title="pages/docs/index.tsx"
export default makeSource({
  contentDirPath: "./content",
  documentTypes: [Blog, Snippet, Project],
  mdx: {
    rehypePlugins: [
        rehypeCodeTitles,
    ],
  },
});
```
