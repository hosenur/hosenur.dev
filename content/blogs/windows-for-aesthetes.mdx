I own a MSI Modern 15 as my daily driver, I use this for web dev, app dev, my freelance works, learning new tech, building my side projects, for my academics and so on. I got this Laptop recently after I joined Uni, before at home I used my PC for all kinds of stuffs and was a huge Linux fanboi, and used Linux as my main as well as only distro for my PC, and it would work like a charm, but the problem with my current laptop is that the bluetooth, wifi drivers are too early stage and proprietary, and everytime I have tried to install any distro in it there is some sort of error of some type, sometimes wifi wouldn't work, sometimes ghost keystorkes would automatically dim or brighten my display and much more. After spending a lot of time trying to fix this and failing all the time, I decieded to sell my soul to Windows and stick with it, because the compatibility was buttery smooth, everything worked perfectly, all the drivers worked,no glitches. But I was habituated with using Linux and the vim keybindings, so I had to find a way out, Installing a Linux distro in a virtual machine would be an option, but why choose that when Windows natively supports Linux distros, A lot of YouTubers have posted how they have setup their development environment using WSL, so I tohught lets give it a try, and in todays blog post I will go through how I set up Hyper, WSL, NeoVim and installed packages to build my development environment.

## Tech we will be using

- [Hyper](https://hyper.is) : A terminal built on web technologies (Crafted by Vercel)
- WSL : Windows Subsystem for Linux
- ZSH : A shell designed for interactive use
- [Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) : A framework for managing ZSH 
- [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) : A collection of over 50 patched fonts
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) : A highly configurable text editor
- [NVChad](https://nvchad.com) : A neovim configuration with keybindings and packages.

### Hyper & Nerd Fonts

> Why Hyper ? : Hyper is a highly customisable terminal emulator built with electron, so it would really allow us to tweak it to fit our taste. Previously, I have tried doing this same setup using Windows terminal, but it is not so configurable and I couldnt get Nerd fonts working on it, there were fixes available, but none of them worked for me, so I decieded to go with Hyper.

Download and install [Hyper](https://hyper.is) from the official website, and navigate to your start menu to launch it.
You should see a black terminal window open up, you can head towards the [plugins page](https://hyper.is/plugins) and look for plugins to change the look and feel of Hyper. I love to make some little tweaks to make it look better, like making the window transparent, and setting up Nerd Fonts.
Install the [hyper-opacity](https://github.com/lucleray/hyper-opacity) plugin, by running the following command, and it shall automatically set a default opacity

```bash showLineNumbers
hyper i hyper-opacity
```

We need Nerd fonts to make out terminal look good and more aesthetically pleasing, you can skip this step but then icons will appear as boxes in your terminal, which makes it look ugly and doesn't reflect the file type or folder type.

Head over to the [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) website, and download the font of your choice, I personally use Space Mono. After installing the font, open up Hyper and go to Edit > Preferences, and change the font to the one you just installed, and you should be good to go.

Here is my Hyper config file, where I have set a preferred font size and font family, you are free to tweak and change it to your liking.

```js showLineNumbers {7,9}
module.exports = {
    config: {
        // choose either `'stable'` for receiving highly polished,
        // or `'canary'` for less polished but more frequent updates
        updateChannel: 'stable',
        // default font size in pixels for all tabs
        fontSize: 14,
        // font family with optional fallbacks
        fontFamily: 'SpaceMono Nerd Font',
        // default font weight: 'normal' or 'bold'
        fontWeight: 'normal',
        // font weight for bold characters: 'normal' or 'bold'
        fontWeightBold: 'bold',
        // line height as a relative unit
        lineHeight: 1,
        // letter spacing as a relative unit
        letterSpacing: 0,
        ...
```

### WSL

To install WSL, run the following command

```js showLineNumbers
wsl --install 
```

 

### Nerd Fonts






Install ZSH

```bash showLineNumbers
sudo apt install zsh
```

Update and Upgrade your system and packages

```bash showLineNumbers
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

Install Neovim

```bash showLineNumbers
curl -LO https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/latest/download/nvim.appimage
chmod u+x nvim.appimage
./nvim.appimage --appimage-extract
sudo mv squashfs-root /
sudo ln -s /squashfs-root/AppRun /usr/bin/nvim
```
