description: CSS for rehype-pretty-code with Tailwind CSS
---

Until now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post with Tailwind has been a tedious task that required a keen eye for typography and a lot of complex custom CSS.

By default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being really useful for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing user-agent styles, but when you _really are_ just trying to style some content that came from a rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.

We get lots of complaints about it actually, with people regularly asking us things like:

The `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin is our attempt to give you what you _actually_ want, without any of the downsides of doing something stupid like disabling our base styles.

It adds a new `prose` class that you can slap on any block of vanilla HTML content and turn it into a beautiful, well-formatted document:

```js showLineNumbers title="multiply.js"{2}
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b
multiply(2, 2) // 4
multiply(2, 2) // 4
```
