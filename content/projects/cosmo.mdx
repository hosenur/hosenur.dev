On my [stacks](https://hosenur.dev/stack) page I list the most important apps and services I use in my day to day life for managing all my tasks and projects. Among all the apps listed the most important ones are Obsidian, VS Code and Todoist. As most of us know Todoist is a task management application which has all the features like projects and reminders but all of them are behind a paywall. So I decided to build an exact clone of Todoist with all the features, but better.

Introducing Cosmo, an open source, free and beautifully designed app. Cosmo is still in a work in progress, working on it to make it better with each commit. Cosmo can be directly cloned and deployed after configuring some environment variables. Cosmo is currently built on the following tech stack:
- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Next UI
- NHost
- GraphQL
