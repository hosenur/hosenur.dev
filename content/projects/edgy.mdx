Edgy is  a personal project born out of a desire for simplicity in the chaotic web of long and messy URLs. We've all been there, right? You want to share a link, and it's this monstrous string of characters that looks like it's trying to break free from the screen.

That's where Edgy steps in, like a digital ninja, making your URLs sleek, concise, and oh-so-easy on the eyes. And guess what? It's all happening in the cloud - thanks to the magic of Cloudflare Workers and the speedy goodness of Upstash Redis.

### How the Magic Happens
- **Cloudflare Workers Kick In**: When you hit an Edgy link, my trusty Cloudflare Worker springs into action right at the edge of the internet universe. It's like having your own URL superhero, but without the cape.

- **Extracting the Good Stuff**: The Worker snatches the 'slug' from your URL – that's the cool, unique part that represents your destination.

- **Upstash Redis**: The Secret Sauce: Edgy then does a quick Upstash Redis lookup. Think of it as Edgy's little notebook where it remembers the original URLs tied to those snazzy slugs.

- **Swift Redirection**: Armed with the right info, Edgy seamlessly guides you to your destination. Blink, and you might miss it – that's how fast we're talking!
