#### Context
If you are someone like me who follows some of the tech influencers and content creators on Twitter and YouTube, you know there is always a frenzy going on, on which technology to choose for either building a porject, deploying a project or both. Everyone tries to push their way to the top, whether because they are paid by a company to do it, or they are the owner of the tech they want to use. Overall you can classify the stacks people try to preach as :
- Complete serverless, infinitely scalable stacks
- Raw $5 VPS stack
- There is a SaaS for feature stack
- Roll your own feature stack

#### Picking my poision
Setting up a VPS would not be a simple task, it's not just spinning up a droplet and everything should work out of the box. Things need to be fault proof, secure and in par with the standards of the industry.

I deployed my VPS on Digital Ocean, in the Bangalore region.
